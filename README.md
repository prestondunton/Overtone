## About

Overtone will be a web app used to explore musical harmony.  Musical composition sits at the intersection of creativity and predictable patterns.  With millions of songs out there, it presents itself as an interesting data science project.  Rather thanprovide defined ways to explore harmony, Overtone will be designed with the purpose of giving people the tools to explore on their own.  The final product could be marketed towards music education or professional musicians.

Overtone is in very early stages right now, meaning there's not much else to discuss in this `README.md`.
